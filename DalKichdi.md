# Dal Kichdi

## Utensils:
 - Sauce pan for the dal
 - Another sauce pan or pan for the tempering
 - A microwaveable bowl for the rice and buckwheat
 - Cutting board and knife
 - Wooden ladle or spoon

## Mise en place:

### Night Before
 Soak dal overnight the night before to reduce farting...you might even prevent it, if you cook the dal and rice right! 
- Dal soak (do all this in the sauce pan that you'll cook the dal):
	- Wash the dal again and again until the water is not muddy. The trick is to lie to yourself that it's a form of meditation.
	- Add double the water. I don't measure this shit, actually I don't measure anything, it adds to the shock factor in the end. What I do is - I dip my pinky finger in the water and keep it touching the surface of the dal as the water slowly fills the sauce pan from the tap. I stop once the water reaches the first line of my pinky finger. For some reason this trick works every time with rice/dal or anything that requires double the water.
	- To this potion, add:
		- Large slices of ginger
		- Some cumin seeds
		- Turmeric
### Cooking day
- **1 red onion**: thinly sliced Cs... following the natural onion layers
- **A can of italian peeled whole tomatoes** (they don't have to be italian): fish out the whole tomatoes with a fork and chop them (roughly). You can save the tomato juice for another recipe.. I popped it in the freezer... not sure what'll happen to it..
- A shit ton of **garlic** (this recipe is not suitable for vampires): slice them not too thin, not too thick, but big (like your ass)
- Olivia (olive oil)
- Spices:
	- Salt
	- Turmeric
	- Pepper
	- Red pepper flakes
	- Svanetian salt (Georgian salt, it slaps!)
	- Chilli powder
	- Ground Caraway
	
## Cooking Instructions

### Dal 
- As you already soaked the dal last night in a sauce pan, all you need to do is put fire under it's ass and maybe add some water. I added more water when it started looking less soupy.
- I placed the wooden spoon on top of it to prevent it from overflowing while boiling
- Overcook this dal... but don't burn it. Again this will prevent you from burning your sofa with your farts 
  
### Rice and Buckwheat 
- Wash the rice again and again until the water is not muddy... are you even asian if you don't do this? if you're not asian, pls learn from us asians!
- Add buckwheat and rinse again. 
- How much rice and buckwheat? idk eye ball it! Enough so that it looks like equal amounts of dal and rice+buckwheat in the end. So how much dal you use in the beginning is the anchor for this
- Add double the water. 
- Pop it in the microwave for about 10 min and forget about it

### Combine Dal, Rice and Buckwheat = Kichdi
- Once the Dal is cooked and the rice+buckwheat is cooked, add the rice+buckwheat mixture to the dal, add some water and cook it further. It shouldn't be soupy but at the same time, it should be mushy once it's consumed and not look mushy... you get it
- Season it with salt, pepper and little more tumeric. Stir it
- At some point, turn off the gas and cover it tightly with a lid and leave it.
- NOW, make the tempering 
- 
### Tempering
- Heat up the pan and make sure that it's dry
- Add Olivia, don't be shy 
- Add the sliced onions once Olivia is hot and ready
- Add the sliced garlic after to prevent it from burning
- When your hair, the clothes you're wearing and the entire house starts smelling like onion and garlic, mix in some red chilli flakes and let it cook
- Add the chopped tomatoes and at the same time, add some Svanetian salt, Chilli powder and Ground Caraway
- Cook until you see the oils separating from the solids

### Combine Tempering and Kichdi
- Add the hot tempering oil mixture on the kichdi
- Fold the tempering into it

## Serve
- I highly recommend a bowl and a spoon
- Also if you don't like chewing on large chunks of ginger like an animal (which I am), feel free to pluck them out of the bowl.

Now find a corner and enjoy this orgasmic kichdi!

You're welcome! <3
