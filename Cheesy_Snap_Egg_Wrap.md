	> You can make this beforehand or save whatever you make for future wraps in a jar
	#### Prep:
	- Slice mushrooms
	- In a small cup, mix some mustard, savory/herb mix, turmeric and black pepper. Add some holy water to this if you fancy it
	#### Cook:
	- Heat pan and make sure it's completely dry and heated
	- Add olive oil, make sure the gas dial is at low-medium
	- Add sliced mushrooms to the pan
	- Cook until they shrink to about half their initial volume
	- Add salt and paprika and watch it shrink further as the salt sucks more water out of the mushrooms
	- Turn off that gas
	- Put the cooked mushrooms in a bowl
	- Mix in the mustard herb mix 
	- Transfer it into a glass jar if you made a lot

## Cooking Instructions
- Heat a frying pan on medium heat, make sure that it dries out completely before adding oil 
- Add some olive oil
- Add half a hand-full of frozen green beans... or how much ever you like, just keep in mind that all of this goes in a wrap in the end
- Lets the beans cook!
- Make sure the gas dial is set to the lowest possible setting
- Crack egg(s) directly onto the fried beans
- Throw the egg shells away
- Keep scraping and stirring the eggs and beans mixture until it looks semi solid. Don't let it turn rubbery!! .. If you did, shaaaame! 🫵 no it's fine, dw
- On a big plate spread out a wrap
- Add the eggs on it
- On the steaming egg mixture, layer the grated gouda cheese
- Then layer the mushrooms (this contains all the seasoning for the wrap, note that the eggs didn't get seasoned on purpose)
- Then add a layer of grated blue cheese (this is an art 🤌)
- Now wrap it up! like a burrrrrito (if you don't know, look it up on youtube, I did)
- If you got ambitious and made too much filling, then just fold all sides into a cuboid. Put some cheese in between the sides and it will act as glue
- Turn the heat on the frying pan to a medium-low dial
- Place the wrapped baby on it
- Let it get golden and flip carefully

## Serve Yourself 💅🏼
- Now place that baby on the big plate and cut it in half

Savor the cheesy goodness, you fancy ass!
You're welcome <3
