# Buttery Papas And Corn
1) Cut a small potato in a bowl and sprinkle some holy water on it and put it in the microhell for 5 min
2) Drain the water out of a small can of sweet corn and set it aside
3) After you have twiddled your thumbs for 5 min, you must be able to stab the little morsels of potatoes like a person; it should feel fleshy
4) Butter up those potatoes while they are warm and add a little bit of mustard to spice things up
5) Add the corn and mix it up
6) Season with salt, pepper and sumac

Now devourer it like the starved hermit you are!
